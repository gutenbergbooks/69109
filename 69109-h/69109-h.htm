<h2>SERIES PUBLICATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION</h2>

<p>Emphasis upon publication as a means of "diffusing knowledge" was
expressed by the first Secretary of the Smithsonian. In his formal plan
for the Institution, Joseph Henry outlined a program that included the
following statement: "It is proposed to publish a series of reports,
giving an account of the new discoveries in science, and of the changes
made from year to year in all branches of knowledge." This theme of
basic research has been adhered to through the years by thousands of
titles issued in series publications under the Smithsonian imprint,
commencing with Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge in 1848 and
continuing with the following active series:</p>

<p class="tdc">
               <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology</i><br />
               <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics</i><br />
                  <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Botany</i><br />
            <i>Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences</i><br />
           <i>Smithsonian Contributions to the Marine Sciences</i><br />
               <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology</i><br />
                 <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology</i><br />
                     <i>Smithsonian Folklife Studies</i><br />
                 <i>Smithsonian Studies in Air and Space</i><br />
             <i>Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology</i>
</p>

<p>In these series, the Institution publishes small papers and full-scale
monographs that report the research and collections of its various
museums and bureaux or of professional colleagues in the world of
science and scholarship. The publications are distributed by mailing
lists to libraries, universities, and similar institutions throughout
the world.</p>

<p>Papers or monographs submitted for series publication are received by
the Smithsonian Institution Press, subject to its own review for format
and style, only through departments of the various Smithsonian museums
or bureaux, where the manuscripts are given substantive review. Press
requirements for manuscript and art preparation are outlined on the
inside back cover.</p>

<p>Olson, Storrs L., and David C. Parris. The Cretaceous Birds of New
Jersey. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, number 63, 22
pages, 11 figures, 1987.—This is a revision of the fossil birds from
Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian; Hornerstown and Navesink formations)
deposits in New Jersey. Material of previously named taxa, described
over a century ago, is augmented by more recently collected specimens
from a new locality at the Inversand Company marl pits near Sewell,
Gloucester County. With about 8 genera and 9 species, this is the most
diverse Cretaceous avifauna yet known. Most species belong to a group
of primitive Charadriiformes resembling in limb morphology the fossil
family Presbyornithidae and the living family Burhinidae. These are
tentatively referred to the "form family" Graculavidae Fürbringer,
1888, with its provisional synonyms Palaeotringinae Wetmore, 1940;
Telmatornithidae Cracraft, 1972, and Laornithidae Cracraft, 1972. The
species included are: <i>Graculavus velox</i> Marsh, 1872; <i>Telmatornis
priscus</i> Marsh, 1870 (synonyms: <i>Telmatornis affinis</i> Marsh, 1870;
<i>Graculavus pumilis</i> Marsh, 1872; <i>Palaeotringa vetus</i> Marsh, 1870);
<i>Anatalavis rex</i> (Shufeldt, 1915); <i>Laornis edvardsianus</i> Marsh, 1870;
<i>Palaeotringa littoralis</i> Marsh, 1870; <i>P. vagans</i> Marsh, 1872; and
an undescribed genus and species probably different from any of the
preceding. <i>Anatalavis</i> is proposed as a new genus for Telmatornis rex
Shufeldt, 1915. A new family, genus, and species (Tytthostonychidae,
<i>Tytthostonyx glauconiticus</i>) is proposed for a humerus showing
similarities to the Pelecaniformes and Procellariiformes and
tentatively referred to the latter, along with an ulna of a much
smaller species. The species in this fauna appear to be part of the
modern radiation of neognathous birds, but none can be referred to
modern families.</p>

<p>Fossils of Cretaceous birds are scarce and usually difficult
to interpret. The better known forms such as <i>Hesperornis</i> and
<i>Ichthyornis</i> belong to strange and archaic groups having little or
nothing to do with the modern avian radiation. The only areas that have
yielded Cretaceous birds of essentially modern aspect in sufficient
quantities to be regarded as avifaunal assemblages are the inland
deposits of the Lance Formation and strata of similar age in Wyoming
(Brodkorb, 1963a) and the marine deposits of New Jersey. Of these, the
assemblage from New Jersey is the more diverse.</p>

<p>Fossil birds were described from the Cretaceous greensands of southern
New Jersey over a century ago by Marsh (1870, 1872). These have been
carried, largely uncritically, in lists and compilations ever since
(e.g. Hay, 1902; Lambrecht, 1933; Rapp, 1943; Miller, 1955; Brodkorb,
1963b, 1967). Although some of these specimens were subsequently
re-examined and their status altered (Shufeldt, 1915; Cracraft, 1972,
1973), there has been no modern comprehensive revision of all of the
avian taxa that have been named from the Cretaceous of New Jersey. In
recent years, additional fossil birds have been recovered from these
deposits that add further to our knowledge of late Mesozoic avifaunas,
making a review of this material all the more desirable.</p>

<p>In spite of the relative diversity of the New Jersey Cretaceous
avifauna, the total number of specimens is still small. The decline
of the glauconite greensand industry and the difficulty of recovering
small fossils have contributed to this paucity of specimens. The
glauconite industry is now confined to a single operation, the
Inversand Company in Sewell, Mantua Township, Gloucester County, New
Jersey. Fortunately, the late owner of the company, Mr. Churchill
Hungerford, Jr., generously allowed fossils to be recovered on his
property by the New Jersey State Museum, which houses most of the newly
discovered specimens, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
being the repository of the rest. Another specimen came from a locality
in Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey and was donated
to the New Jersey State Museum by Gerard R. Case.</p>

<p id="Acknowledgments"><span class="smcap">Acknowledgments.</span>—We gratefully acknowledge the late Churchill
Hungerford, Jr., for permitting fossil material to be recovered from
his property by the New Jersey State Museum (NJSM). We are much
indebted to John H. Ostrom, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale
University (YPM), and Gay Vostreys and Charles Smart of the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) for their patience in
lending types and other material from their collections for a very
extended period. Pat V. Rich, Monash University, assisted Parris in
the early stages of this study. Comparative material of <i>Presbyornis</i>
was obtained from the collection of the University of California
Museum of Paleontology (UCMP), the University of Wyoming (UW), and the
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM).

<p>The extensive deposits of Cretaceous age in eastern North America
have been widely studied for over 150 years. These generally poorly
consolidated sediments have provided valuable resources, notably
glauconite, fire clay, and chalk. As the publications by Morton (1829),
Vanuxem (1829), Conrad (1869), and other early authors showed, the
sediments are also quite fossiliferous.</p>

<p>In the eastern United States, significant Cretaceous deposits occur
from New Jersey to Texas (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>), with extensive outcrop and
subsurface records in both Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. The
surface distribution and correlations were first summarized by
Stephenson et al. (1942). Subsequent works by various authorities
have refined, but not substantially altered his views of outcrop
stratigraphy. Petroleum exploration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span> has encouraged more recent restudy
of the subsurface stratigraphy, notably along the east coast (Minard et
al., 1974; Perry et al., 1975; Petters, 1976).</p>

<p>In New Jersey, the latest Cretaceous deposits are remarkably rich
in glauconite, especially the Navesink and Hornerstown formations.
Besides providing a local industry in agricultural fertilizers, the
glauconite greensands, locally called "marl," yielded many specimens to
the fiercely competitive vertebrate paleontologists of the nineteenth
century. Preservation of vertebrate fossils in a glauconite deposit may
be excellent, apparently due to autochthonous formation of the mineral
and the probable quiescence of the depositional environment. The
Hornerstown Formation, for example, contains few grains of terrigenous
origin and little evidence of disturbance by water currents.
Such depositional environments were apparently favorable for the
preservation of small and delicate bones. The accumulation of sediment
occurred during a period of marine transgression with the shoreline not
far to the northwest but at sufficient distance to prevent deposition
of terrigenous material.</p>

<p>During their great rivalry, E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh sought greensand
fossils vigorously. Marsh, however, obtained all of the Cretaceous
birds (Marsh, 1870, 1872), largely due to efforts of marl pit owner
J.G. Meirs. Although in the years subsequent to Marsh's original
descriptions of the New Jersey birds from the Navesink and Hornerstown
formations there was some confusion regarding their probable age
(Wetmore, 1930), this was later definitely established as Cretaceous
by Baird (1967), who attributed the specimens to the Navesink and
Hornerstown formations.</p>

<p>The summary of Petters (1976) represents current ideas of the
Cretaceous stratigraphy of New Jersey. Baird's (1967) discussion is
consistent with Petters's view that the Hornerstown Formation is
regarded as partly Cretaceous and partly Tertiary. Some authors have
used the term New Egypt Formation instead of Navesink in more southerly
outcrops.</p>

<p>Cretaceous birds have been recovered from three geographically
distinct localities in New Jersey (<a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>). With the exception of
<i>Laornis</i>, all of the specimens described by Marsh (1870, 1872) came
from Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span> County, in the area including
the settlements of Hornerstown, Arneytown, and Cream Ridge. The Meirs
family operated a number of pits in this area and it is no longer
possible to ascertain the exact provenance of specimens labelled only
as being from Hornerstown. These could have come either from the
basal Hornerstown Formation or the underlying Navesink Formation,
both of which are Maastrichtian in age. Baird (1967:261) ascertained
that the holotype of <i>Palaeotringa vetus</i>, from "friable green marl
near Arneytown" was from the lower (i.e., Cretaceous) part of the
Hornerstown Formation. The holotypes of <i>Telmatornis priscus</i> and <i>T.
affinis</i>, from the Cream Ridge Marl Company pits, on the other hand,
are from the Navesink Formation. A more recently collected specimen
from this area is the proximal end of an ulna (NJSM 11900) collected
by Gerard R. Case from "marl piles near junction of Rtes. 537 and
539 in Upper Freehold Twp., Monmouth County, near Hornerstown." This
definitely came from the Hornerstown Formation but it cannot be said
whether from the Cretaceous or Paleocene sediments included therein.</p>

</div>

<p>The second general locality is near Birmingham, Burlington County,
where the type of <i>Laornis edvardsianus</i> was obtained from "greensand
of the upper, Cretaceous marl bed ... in the pits of the Pemberton Marl
Company" (Marsh, 1870:208). There is nothing to be added to Baird's
(1967) conclusion that this specimen is latest Cretaceous in age.</p>

<p>The third locality, and that yielding most of the recently obtained
specimens, is the Inversand Company marl pit, located near Sewell,
Gloucester County. In accordance with the wishes of the Inversand
Company, the precise locality of this pit will not be disclosed,
although this information is preserved in records sufficient in number
and distribution to assure that it will not be lost. The Inversand
specimens came from the main fossiliferous layer within the basal
portion of the Hornerstown Formation (<a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a>). This layer is of late
Maastrichtian age (latest Cretaceous), on the basis of invertebrate
fossils, including three genera of ammonites, and a substantial
vertebrate fauna, including mosasaurs (see Appendix). It is probable
that the upper part of the Hornerstown Formation within the pit is of
Paleocene age, as it is known to be elsewhere, but most paleontologists
believe the basal portion to be Cretaceous in age (Gaffney, 1975; Koch
and Olsson, 1977). One avian specimen is from an unknown level in the
pit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Included Genera.</span>—<i>Graculavus</i> Marsh, 1872; <i>Telmatornis</i> Marsh, 1870;
<i>Anatalavis</i>, new genus; <i>Laornis</i> Marsh, 1870; <i>Palaeotringa</i> Marsh,
1870; and an additional unnamed genus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—Most of the birds from the New Jersey deposits belong with
what Olson (1985) has termed the "transitional Charadriiformes," a
group that seemingly tends to connect the Gruiformes and the more
typical Charadriiformes. The only living family in this group that
has traditionally been considered charadriiform is the Burhinidae,
the thick-knees or stone curlews. Other apparent descendants include
ibises (Plataleidae) and the ducks and geese of the order Anseriformes.
The latter are linked with the "transitional Charadriiformes" through
the Paleocene and Eocene genus <i>Presbyornis</i>, which is known from
abundant material from widely scattered areas of the world (Olson and
Feduccia, 1980b; Olson, 1985). <i>Presbyornis</i> combines a long-legged
shorebird-like body with the head of a duck. The fragmentary Cretaceous
fossils from New Jersey, all of which are postcranial, usually show
more similarity to <i>Presbyornis</i> than to any modern group of birds
except the Burhinidae. Therefore, our comparisons have been made
chiefly with these two groups.</p>

<p>With the fragmentary material at hand it is difficult, well nigh
impossible, to make hard and fast taxonomic judgments concerning the
number of species, genera, or families represented. Birds with very
similar wing or leg elements could have had completely different
feeding adaptations and could represent ancestral forms leading to
different modern groups not considered to be closely related. For
example, without the skull, <i>Presbyornis</i> could not be determined as
having anything to do with the Anseriformes (Olson and Feduccia, 1980b:
12-13).</p>

<p>Late Cretaceous fossil birds of modern aspect have been described in
a variety of genera, most of which have been used as the basis for
family-group names. Taxa from New Jersey that appear to belong with
the "transitional Charadriiformes" for which family-group names are
available include: Graculavinae Fürbringer, 1888; Palaeotringinae
Wetmore, 1940; Telmatornithidae Cracraft, 1972; and Laornithidae
Cracraft, 1973.</p>

<p>Taxa from Upper Cretaceous deposits in western North America that
appear to fall in the same category (Olson and Feduccia, 1980a)
include: Apatornithidae Fürbringer, 1888; Cimolopterygidae Brodkorb,
1963a; Torotigidae Brodkorb, 1963a; and Lonchodytidae Brodkorb, 1963a.</p>

<p>Tertiary taxa that may possibly be related to the "transitional
Charadriiformes" and that have been used as the basis of family-group
names are: Presbyornithidae Wetmore, 1926 (Nautilornithinae Wetmore,
1926, and Telmabatidae Howard, 1955, are definitely synonyms);
Scaniornithidae Lambrecht, 1933; and Dakotornithidae Erickson, 1975.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are others that we have overlooked. How many families
are actually represented here and what their interrelationships may
be is purely a matter of conjecture in the absence of better fossil
material. Because the entire skeleton of <i>Presbyornis</i> is known, the
familial name Presbyornithidae may justifiably be retained and used for
that genus.</p>

<p>In the case of the Cretaceous birds under consideration here, we
have decided for the time being to adopt a version of paleobotanical
convention in recognizing a "form family" Graculavidae, which implies a
general similarity in morphology of the constituent taxa, although the
material available is simply not sufficient for determining phylogeny
or key adaptations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparisons.</span>—Marsh (1872) originally described this as a species of
cormorant (Phalacrocoracidae, Pelecaniformes) and included the species
<i>G. pumilis</i> Marsh, 1872, also from New Jersey, and <i>G. anceps</i> Marsh,
1872, from the Late Cretaceous of Kansas, in the same genus. Marsh
(1880) later referred <i>G. anceps</i> to the genus <i>Ichthyornis</i>, where it
has remained. Shufeldt (1915:17-19) went into considerable detail to
show that the species of <i>Graculavus</i>, particularly <i>G. velox</i>, were
not cormorants, instead being limicoline shorebirds with similarities
to the Burhinidae, Haematopodidae, and Charadriidae. Accordingly,
Lambrecht (1933:540, 546) placed these taxa among the charadriiform
birds, but rather inexplicably listed velox under Shufeldt's substitute
name <i>Limosavis</i> in the suborder Laro-Limicolae, while retaining
<i>pumilis</i> in the genus <i>Graculavus</i> in the suborder Limicolae.
Brodkorb (1963b:249) ignored Shufeldt's assessment of relationships
and placed <i>G. velox</i> and <i>G. pumilis</i> in the Phalacrocoracidae,
subfamily Graculavinae. Cracraft (1972) did not examine the specimens
attributed to <i>Graculavus</i> in his consideration of the relationships of
<i>Telmatornis</i>.</p>

<p>We have synonymized <i>Graculavus pumilis</i> Marsh, 1872, with
<i>Telmatornis priscus</i> Marsh, 1870, and discuss below the characters
by which <i>Graculavus</i> (restricted to <i>G. velox</i>) may be separated
from <i>Telmatornis</i>. Shufeldt (1915) has already presented adequate
evidence that <i>Graculavus</i> is not a cormorant and is instead a
charadriiform. The following combination of characters of the proximal
end of the humerus is shared by <i>Graculavus</i> and <i>Presbyornis</i> and
distinguishes these genera from other Charadriiformes: (1) lack of
a distinct lanceolate scar for M. coracobrachialis cranialis; (2)
lack of a distinctly excavated second (dorsal) tricipital fossa; (3)
presence of a distinct tumescence in the proximoventral portion of the
tricipital fossa; scars for (4) M. scapulohumeralis caudalis and (5)
M. scapulohumeralis cranialis very large and distinct; (6) attachment
of M. latissimus dorsi cranialis a well-defined, raised protuberance
situated dorsal to the median ridge of the shaft; (7) tuberculum
dorsale well defined, distinctly pointed. In most of the preceding
characters that it preserves, the single proximal end of humerus
referred to <i>Telmatornis</i> (the holotype of <i>G. pumilis</i>) agrees with
<i>Graculavus</i> and <i>Presbyornis</i>.</p>

<p>Among living families, the Burhinidae are the most similar to
<i>Graculavus</i>; both agree in characters 1, 2, 4, and 7, with certain
species of <i>Burhinus</i> also having characters 3 and 6 present but less
developed. <i>Graculavus</i> differs from Burhinus mainly in having (8) the
head not as deep and bulbous; (9) distance from head to tuberculum
dorsale greater; (10) tuberculum dorsale smaller, much less projecting;
(11) tuberculum ventrale in ventral view more elongate; and (12) scar
on tuberculum ventrale for M. coracobrachialis caudalis much larger and
more distinct.</p>

<p><i>Graculavus</i> is very similar to <i>Presbyornis</i>, agreeing with that
genus in characters 8 and 10 but differing in characters 11 and 12
and in (13) having the head more deeply undercut. <i>Presbyornis</i> is
intermediate between <i>Graculavus</i> and the <i>Burhinidae</i> in character 9.</p>

<p><i>Graculavus velox</i> was a fairly large bird, being approximately the
size of <i>Presbyornis</i> cf. <i>pervetus</i> and somewhat larger than the large
living burhinid <i>Esacus magnirostris</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparisons.</span>—This is evidently the most abundant bird in the
New Jersey Cretaceous deposits. Hitherto it had been known only
from the two distal ends of humeri that are the holotypes of
<i>Telmatornis priscus</i> and <i>T. affinis</i>. Marsh (1870) did not clearly
place <i>Telmatornis</i> with any living family but mentioned species
of Rallidae, Scolopacidae, and Ardeidae in his comparisons. Hay
(1902:528) listed the genus under the Rallidae. Shufeldt (1915:26)
considered that <i>Telmatornis</i> was not a heron but might be related
either to rail-like or charadriiform birds, the material, according
to him, being insufficient for positive determination. He (1915:27)
also described a larger species, <i>Telmatornis rex</i>, which we have
removed to a new genus. Lambrecht (1933:489) maintained <i>Telmatornis</i>
as a genus incertae sedis in his order Ralliformes. Brodkorb (1967)
placed the genus in the family Rallidae, subfamily Rallinae, without
comment. Cracraft (1972) established that Telmatornis did not belong
in the Rallidae but was instead very similar to the Burhinidae. He
synonymized <i>T. affinis</i> with <i>T. priscus</i> and created a new family,
Telmatornithidae, for <i>T. priscus</i> and <i>T. rex</i>.</p>

<p>We concur in synonymizing <i>T. affinis</i> with <i>T. priscus</i>. The holotypes
and the new specimen of humerus (ANSP 15360), which is instructive in
that it preserves much more of the shaft (<a href="#Figure6">Figure 6<i>c</i></a>), are indeed
very similar to the humeri in the Burhinidae. In size they are closely
comparable to the small living species <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i> (cf.
<a href="#Figure6">Figure 6<i>g,h</i></a>). The fossils differ from <i>Burhinus</i> in having (1) the
shaft less curved, both in dorsal and in lateral views; (2) brachial
depression shorter, wider, and slightly more distally located; in
distal view (3) the ventral condyle smaller and less rounded; and (4)
the dorsal tricipital groove shallower.</p>

<p>The distal portion of the humerus of <i>Telmatornis</i> is similar to that
in <i>Presbyornis</i> but differs in having (1) the dorsal condyle decidedly
more elongate; (2) olecranal fossa much shallower; (3) ventral
epicondyle in ventral view less distinctly demarcated but (4) more
protrudent in lateral or medial view.</p>

<p>The proximal end of humerus (YPM 850) that is the holotype of
<i>Graculavus pumilis</i> was considered by Shufeldt (1915:19) definitely
to be from a limicoline charadriiform. It is from a bird exactly the
size of <i>Telmatornis priscus</i> and its coloration and preservation would
not be incompatible with its being the opposite end of the same bone
as the holotype of <i>T. affinis</i> (<a href="#Figure5">Figure 5<i>b,c,f,g</i></a>). The following
differences between the holotypical humeri of <i>G. velox</i> and _<i>"G."
pumilis</i> establish that these belong to different genera: (1) in
<i>velox</i> the area dorsal to the ventral tubercle and distal to the head
is much more excavated, undercutting the head; (2) the dorsal tubercle
is more pronounced; (3) there is a distinct excavation distomedial to
the ventral tubercle, lacking in <i>pumilis</i>; (4) the ventral tubercle in
ventral view is much more produced in <i>velox</i> than in <i>pumilis</i>.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>G. pumilis</i> is very similar to the humerus in the
Burhinidae but differs from that family and agrees with <i>Graculavus</i>
in characters 8, 9, and 10 (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>). It differs further from the
Burhinidae in having the area for the attachment of M. scapulohumeralis
caudalis extending farther distally in ventral view. It differs from
<i>Presbyornis</i> mainly in lacking the excavation to and undercutting
the head. Because pumilis is not congeneric with <i>Graculavus velox</i>
and because of its size and similarities with the Burhinidae and
<i>Presbyornis</i>, we have no hesitation about considering Graculavus
pumilis Marsh, 1872, to be a junior subjective synonym of <i>Telmatornis
priscus</i> Marsh, 1870.</p>

<p>The proximal end of an ulna, NJSM 11900 (<a href="#Figure5">Figure 5<i>j</i></a>), is from a bird
the size of <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i> and not too dissimilar to it
except that the shaft is more robust in the fossil. The specimen is
too imperfect to merit detailed study and is referred to Telmatornis
priscus only on size and probability.</p>

<p>The very fragmentary distal end of carpometacarpus associated with the
type of <i>G. pumilis</i> (<a href="#Figure5">Figure 5<i>i</i></a>) is slightly larger and more robust
than in <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i>, but not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span> so much as to be incompatible
with <i>T. priscus</i>. Compared to <i>Burhinus</i> (1) the symphysial area
is deeper and (2) the articular surface for the major digit is
proportionately larger, the specimen being somewhat more similar to the
carpometacarpus in <i>Presbyornis</i>.</p>

<p>The three specimens of <i>Palaeotringa</i> Marsh from the Cretaceous of New
Jersey are based on poorly preserved distal ends of tibiotarsi. The
holotype of <i>Palaeotringa vetus</i> Marsh, 1870 (<a href="#Figure7">Figure 7<i>n</i></a>) is similar
in size to the comparable element in <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i>, though
with a relatively more slender shaft, and hence is from a bird the
size of <i>T. priscus</i>, being smaller than any of the other species of
<i>Palaeotringa</i>. It is more similar to <i>Presbyornis</i> than to <i>Burhinus</i>.
Because it is from a charadriiform the size of <i>T. priscus</i>, as first
revisers we tentatively consider <i>Palaeotringa vetus</i> Marsh, 1870,
to be a subjective synonym of <i>Telmatornis priscus</i> Marsh, 1870. The
only alternative would be to consign it to Aves incertae sedis. It is
of passing historical interest to recall Marsh's (1870:209) comment
that the type of <i>Palaeotringa vetus</i> "apparently was the first fossil
bird-bone discovered in this country," having been mentioned both by
Morton (1834) and Harlan (1835) as belonging to the genus <i>Scolopax</i>
(Charadriiformes: Scolopacidae).</p>

<p>The distal portion of tarsometatarsus NJSM 11853 (<a href="#Figure7">Figure 7<i>d,g,f</i></a>)
is unfortunately quite abraded. It is from a small charadriiform and
has a shaft width about the same as in <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i>. If
this fossil came from an individual of <i>Telmatornis priscus</i>, as we
assume, <i>T. priscus</i> being the smallest and most abundant "graculavid"
in the New Jersey Cretaceous deposits, then it is a very instructive
specimen, for it differs much more from Burhinus than does the humerus
of Telmatornis. NJSM 11853 differs from the Burhinidae and agrees with
<i>Presbyornis</i> in having (1) the distal foramen proportionately large
and oval, not very small and circular; (2) a large, well-developed scar
for the hallux (hallux absent in Burhinidae); (3) external trochlea
proximodistally more elongate. That which remains of the inner trochlea
indicates that it was (1) somewhat more posteriorly retracted than
in <i>Burhinus</i> but (2) not nearly as elevated and retracted as in
<i>Presbyornis</i>.</p>

<p>Pedal phalanx ANSP 15541 (<a href="#Figure7">Figure 7<i>a</i></a>) is from a bird the size of <i>T.
priscus</i>. This specimen is much longer and more slender than phalanx 1
of digit II in <i>Burhinus vermiculatus</i> but has almost exactly the shape
and proportions of the same element in <i>Presbyornis</i> (<a href="#Figure7">Figure 7<i>b</i></a>),
although being much smaller. Although its assignment to <i>Telmatornis</i>
is very tentative, the length of this element seems to indicate a
wading bird as opposed to one with the terrestrially adapted shorter
toes of the Burhinidae.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—Shufeldt (1915:27) described this species in the same genus
as <i>T. priscus</i> and <i>T. affinis</i> but correctly noted that the humerus
"is a short one ... its sigmoid curve very pronounced." Cracraft
(1972:41) considered that "except for its decidedly larger size, <i>T.
rex</i> does not differ from <i>T. priscus</i> in any significant features."
In fairness to these authors, it should be noted that the great
differences between Anatalavis and Telmatornis are much more apparent
in comparisons with the new humerus of <i>T. priscus</i> (ANSP 15360), which
preserves much more of the shaft than the previously known specimens.
Both Shufeldt and Cracraft considered YPM 948 to belong to the same
species as the holotype of <i>T. rex</i>, and we concur.</p>

<p>The specimens of <i>A. rex</i> are not comparable with the type of
<i>Graculavus velox</i>, which was from a larger bird. <i>Anatalavis rex</i>
was a larger, heavier bird than <i>Telmatornis priscus</i>, with the
humerus remarkably short and robust, so that the overall length of the
humerus in <i>A. rex</i> would scarcely have exceeded that of <i>T. priscus</i>.
<i>Anatalavis</i> must have been a bird of considerably different flight
habits from <i>Telmatornis</i> or <i>Presbyornis</i>. The overall appearance of
its humerus is in fact rather duck-like, except for the more expanded
distal end. It is still quite short and stout even for a duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparisons.</span>—The very large size of this specimen has undoubtedly
been a factor in misleading those who have attempted to identify
it, as it came from a bird the size of a swan or a large crane.
The affinities of this fossil have long been questioned and the
species has for most of its history been in limbo. Marsh (1870:207)
concluded only that <i>Laornis</i> "shows a strong resemblance in several
respects to the <i>Lamellirostres</i> [Anseriformes], and also to the
<i>Longipennes</i> [Charadriiformes (Lari) and Procellariiformes], but
differs essentially from the typical forms of both of these groups." In
its own nebulous way, this assessment is concordant with our placement
of <i>Laornis</i> in a charadriiform group that was near the ancestry of
the Anseriformes. Doubtless only on the strength of Marsh's comments.
Cope (1869-1870:237) placed <i>Laornis</i> in the "Lamellirostres." Hay
(1902:531) included <i>Laornis</i> in the Anatidae. Shufeldt (1915:23)
hardly clarified matters when he characterized <i>Laornis</i> as "at least
one of the generalized types of waders," being a "remarkable type,
which seems to have, judging from this piece of the tibiotarsus,
Turkey, Swan, Crane, and even other groups all combined in it."
Lambrecht (1933:526) included <i>Laornis</i> as a genus incertae sedis in
his "Telmatoformes," between the Aramidae and Otididae.</p>

<p>The type was restudied by Cracraft (1973:46) who put <i>Laornis</i> in the
Gruiformes and created a new family (Laornithidae) and superfamily
(Laornithoidea) for it. He included it in his suborder Ralli, the only
other member of which was the Rallidae. After preliminary comparisons,
Olson (1974) ventured that <i>Laornis</i> belonged in the suborder Lari
of the Charadriiformes. Brodkorb (1978:214) listed <i>Laornis</i> under
Aves incertae sedis and guessed that it might be related to the
Pelecaniformes.</p>

<p>Except for the extreme difference in size, the tibiotarsus of <i>Laornis</i>
is in many respects similar to that of <i>Presbyornis</i> (<a href="#Figure8">Figure 8</a>),
especially in (1) the shape and position of the tubercle proximal to
the external condyle; (2) the transverse pit in the intercondylar
sulcus; and (3) the broad, shallow intercondylar sulcus as seen in
distal view. It differs in a seemingly minor but quite characteristic
feature, the large nutrient foramen situated in the groove for M.
peroneus brevis (<a href="#Figure8">Figure 8<i>c</i></a>). This is absent in <i>Presbyornis</i> but is
present in both of the tibiotarsi from the Cretaceous of New Jersey
in which that portion of the bone is preserved (the holotypes of
Palaeotringa littoralis and <i>P. vagans</i>), as well as in a tibiotarsus
(Science Museum of Minnesota P75.22.25) from the type-locality of
<i>Dakotornis cooperi</i> Erickson, 1975, that may be referable to that
graculavid-like species. The foramen in the peroneus brevis groove
may also be found in at least some specimens of Stercorariidae, which
is partly what led Olson (1974) to suggest a relationship between
<i>Laornis</i> and the Lari. <i>Laornis</i> appears to have been an extremely
large member of the "transitional Charadriiformes," though where its
relationships may lie within that group cannot be determined.</p>

than decidedly rounded. If we have correctly referred <i>P. vetus</i> to

vagans</i> the tendinal groove appears to be much narrower and the bridge
much deeper than in <i>P. littoralis</i>, but this is in part due to damage
and possible immaturity in the latter specimen, so it remains possible
that these species are in fact congeneric. The species <i>P. vagans</i> can

larger, much deeper, and more proximally situated brachial depression.
It represents a species distinct from any of the others yet known
in the fauna and is certainly generically distinct from all except
possibly <i>Graculavus</i>, for which comparable elements are unknown.</p>

<p>Among the newly collected material from the Inversand pit is a singular
avian humerus that cannot be assigned to the Graculavidae or to
any other known family, fossil or modern. Although it is generally
inadvisable to name even Paleogene birds on single elements, to say
nothing of Cretaceous ones, the specimen under consideration here is
superior to any of the other avian fossils yet collected from the
Cretaceous of New Jersey, both in preservation and in diagnostic
qualities, and it would seem incongruous to leave it innominate when
practically all the other fragments from the same deposits have
received names.</p>

<p>The most distinctive features of this specimen are the deep brachial
depression and the incipient ectepicondylar spur, thus calling to mind
both the Lari (Charadriiformes) and the Procellariiformes among modern
birds. Among the Pelecaniformes it also bears a resemblance to the
Phaethontidae and especially to the Eocene frigatebird <i>Limnofregata</i>
(Fregatidae) (Olson, 1977).</p>

<i>Phaethon</i> and <i>Limnofregata</i> in characters 2 and 4, and in the large,
deeply excavated brachial depression. The ectepicondylar spur is better
developed than in any of the Pelecaniformes but not as well developed
as in the Procellariiformes. The apparently very broad pectoral crest
extends much farther distally than in any of the Procellariiformes or
even in <i>Limnofregata</i>, to which the fossil is somewhat more similar
in this respect. <i>Tytthostonyx</i> differs from any of the taxa compared in
having the ventral condyle very rounded, extending distally well past
the dorsal condyle.</p>

or gray, sea-colored, applied to greensands because of their color,
although appropriate because of their marine origins as well; in
reference to the holotype having been recovered from beds of glauconite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—A possible relationship between the Procellariiformes and
Pelecaniformes has been previously suggested (Sibley and Ahlquist,
1972:70; Olson, 1985:142), and among the pelecaniform taxa most often
mentioned as being procellariiform-like are the Fregatidae. It is
tempting to regard the humerus of <i>Tytthostonyx</i> as being similar
to that possessed by the ancestral stock that gave rise to the
Procellariiformes. Its similarities also to the Eocene frigatebird
<i>Limnofregata</i> would thus be seen as corroborating the primitiveness
of the Fregatidae within the Pelecaniformes. Whereas <i>Tytthostonyx</i>
definitely has not achieved the highly distinctive and presumably
derived morphology of the humerus of modern Procellariiformes, the
incipient development of the ectepicondylar spur and deep brachial
depression could be interpreted as tending in that direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must admit that we are dealing with only a
single bone and one of very great age at that, so that the risk of
overinterpreting the fossil is correspondingly great. We can only
discern the overall similarities of the specimen and phylogenetic
inferences can therefore be only tentative at best.</p>

attachment of the secondaries. It differs from the Oceanitidae in
having the ventral lip of the external condyle much more rounded and
protrudent past the plane of the shaft, whereas the carpal tubercle in
dorsal view is markedly smaller. On this basis, the fossil certainly
could not be referred to the Oceanitidae and that it should be
associated with the Procellariiformes may be doubted as well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Discussion"><b>Discussion</b></h2>
</div>


<p>Because the specimens treated here are avian and of Mesozoic age, it is
almost certain that too much importance will be made of them by some
future authors. Indeed, it will probably be years before the literature
can be expunged of the records of presumed occurrences that arose from
previous misidentifications of these fossils. Therefore, in an effort
to forestall overenthusiasm for these fragments we shall present our
own brief assessment of their significance.</p>

<p>Unlike most other Cretaceous birds, such as the Hesperornithiformes,
Ichthyornithiformes, and Enantiornithiformes, which represent totally
extinct lineages (Olson, 1985), the Cretaceous birds of New Jersey are
of essentially modern aspect. However, there are no modern families
of birds represented in the fauna. The differences among the fossils
suggest that at least two orders are represented, but whether any or
all of the species can be placed in modern orders is more difficult
to say. This stems as much from the unsatisfactory state of the
ordinal classification of modern birds (Olson, 1981, 1985), as from
the incompleteness of the fossils. There are certain modern birds, for
example the Burhinidae, with sufficient similarities to some of the
Cretaceous fossils that there would be no problem with associating them
in the same ordinal-level taxon, though it would be more difficult to
say which other modern families should also be included.</p>

<p>The material is too poor to state how many families are represented
in the fauna, although if the various members of the "form-family"
Graculavidae were better known there can scarcely be any doubt that
more than one family would be recognized in this group. Within
the Graculavidae from New Jersey there appear to be six genera
(<i>Graculavus</i>, <i>Telmatornis</i>, <i>Palaeotringa</i>, <i>Laornis</i>, <i>Anatalavis</i>,
and an unnamed genus). These are diverse, ranging in size from the
smallest of the modern Burhinidae to that of a large crane. The very
short, robust, curved humeri of <i>Anatalavis</i> indicate some diversity in
mode of flight as well. The greatest similarity of most of these forms
is to the early Paleogene bird <i>Presbyornis</i>, and then to the modern
family Burhinidae. Because these two groups are very different in their
habits and feeding adaptations we may expect that the various members
of the Graculavidae were probably as divergent from one another as are
<i>Presbyornis</i> and <i>Burhinus</i>, their similarities being almost certainly
due to the retention of primitive characters.</p>

<p>Including the two genera and species that show some similarities to the
Procellariiformes, along with the small indeterminate femur, the total
avifauna from the New Jersey greensands comprises 8 or 9 genera and 9
or 10 species. As far as can be determined, all of the birds in this
assemblage were probably marine or littoral in habits. We certainly
would not interpret this as indicating that waterbirds are primitive
and that they gave rise to land birds, as suggested by Thulborn and
Hamley (1985) in their fantastic and highly improbable conjectures as
to the mode of life of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. Indeed, just the opposite is
probably the case (Olson, 1985), the lack of Late Cretaceous fossils of
truly terrestrial or arboreal birds most likely being due to sampling
bias.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="REQUIREMENTS_FOR_SMITHSONIAN_SERIES_PUBLICATION"><b>REQUIREMENTS FOR SMITHSONIAN SERIES PUBLICATION</b></h2>
</div>


<p><b>Manuscripts</b> intended for series publication receive substantive
review (conducted by their originating Smithsonian museums or offices)
and are submitted to the Smithsonian Institution Press with Form SI-36,
which must show the approval of the appropriate authority designated by
the sponsoring organizational unit. Requests for special treatment—use
of color, foldouts, case-bound covers, etc.—require, on the same form,
the added approval of the sponsoring authority.</p>

<p><b>Review</b> of manuscripts and art by the Press for requirements of series
format and style, completeness and clarity of copy, and arrangement of
all material, as outlined below, will govern, within the judgment of
the Press, acceptance or rejection of manuscripts and art.</p>

<p><b>Copy</b> must be prepared on typewriter or word processor, double-spaced,
on one side of standard white bond paper (not erasable), with 1¼"
margins, submitted as ribbon copy (not carbon or xerox), in loose
sheets (not stapled or bound), and accompanied by original art. Minimum
acceptable length is 30 pages.</p>

<p><b>Front matter</b> (preceding the text) should include: <b>title page</b> with
only title and author and no other information, <b>abstract page</b> with
author, title, series, etc., following the established format; table of
<b>contents</b> with indents reflecting the hierarchy of heads in the paper;
also, <b>foreword</b> and/or <b>preface</b>, if appropriate.</p>

<p><b>First page of text</b> should carry the title and author at the top
of the page; <b>second page</b> should have only the author's name and
professional mailing address, to be used as an unnumbered footnote on
the first page of printed text.</p>

<p><b>Center heads</b> of whatever level should be typed with initial caps of
major words, with extra space above and below the head, but no other
preparation (such as all caps or underline, except for the underline
necessary for generic and specific epithets). Run-in paragraph heads
should use period/dashes or colons as necessary.</p>

<p><b>Tabulations</b> within text (lists of data, often in parallel columns)
can be typed on the text page where they occur, but they should not
contain rules or numbered table captions.</p>

<p><b>Formal tables</b> (numbered, with captions, boxheads, stubs, rules)
should be submitted as carefully typed, double-spaced copy separate
from the text; they will be typeset unless otherwise requested. If
camera-copy use is anticipated, do not draw rules on manuscript copy.</p>

<p><b>Taxonomic keys</b> in natural history papers should use the
aligned-couplet form for zoology and may use the multi-level indent
form for botany. If cross referencing is required between key and text,
do not include page references within the key, but number the keyed-out
taxa, using the same numbers with their corresponding heads in the text.</p>

<p><b>Synonymy</b> in zoology must use the short form (taxon, author,
year:page), with full reference at the end of the paper under
"Literature Cited." For botany, the long form (taxon, author,
abbreviated journal or book title, volume, page, year, with no
reference in "Literature Cited") is optional.</p>

<p><b>Text-reference system</b> (author, year: page used within the text, with
full citation in "Literature Cited" at the end of the text) must be
used in place of bibliographic footnotes in all Contributions Series
and is strongly recommended in the Studies Series: "(Jones, 1910:122)"
or "...Jones (1910:122)." If bibliographic footnotes are required, use
the short form (author, brief title, page) with the full citation in
the bibliography.</p>

<p><b>Footnotes</b>, when few in number, whether annotative or bibliographic,
should be typed on separate sheets and inserted immediately after the
text pages on which the references occur. Extensive notes must be
gathered together and placed at the end of the text in a notes section.</p>

<p><b>Bibliography</b>, depending upon use, is termed "Literature Cited,"
"References," or "Bibliography." Spell out titles of books, articles,
journals, and monographic series. For book and article titles use
sentence-style capitalization according to the rules of the language
employed (exception: capitalize all major words in English). For
journal and series titles, capitalize the initial word and all
subsequent words except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.
Transliterate languages that use a non-Roman alphabet according to the
Library of Congress system. Underline (for italics) titles of journals
and series and titles of books that are not part of a series. Use the
parentheses/colon system for volume (number): pagination: "10(2):5-9,"
For alignment and arrangement of elements, follow the format of recent
publications in the series for which the manuscript is intended.
Guidelines for preparing bibliography may be secured from Series
Section, SI Press.</p>

<p><b>Legends</b> for illustrations must be submitted at the end of the
manuscript, with as many legends typed, double-spaced, to a page as
convenient.</p>

<p><b>Illustrations</b> must be submitted as original art (not copies)
accompanying, but separate from, the manuscript. Guidelines for
preparing art may be secured from Series Section, SI Press. Ail
types of illustrations (photographs, line drawings, maps, etc.) may
be intermixed throughout the printed text. They should be termed
<b>Figures</b> and should be numbered consecutively as they will appear in
the monograph. If several illustrations are treated as components of a
single composite figure, they should be designated by lowercase italic
letters on the illustration; also, in the legend and in text references
the italic letters (underlined in copy) should be used: "<a href="#Figure9">Figure 9</a>b."
Illustrations that are intended to follow the printed text may be
termed <b>Plates</b>, and any components should be similarly lettered and
referenced: "Plate 9b " Keys to any symbols within an illustration
should appear on the art rather than in the legend.</p>

<p><b>Some points of style:</b> Do not use periods after such abbreviations
as "mm, ft, USNM, NNE." Spell out numbers "one" through "nine" in
expository text, but use digits in all other cases if possible.
Use of the metric system of measurement is preferable; where use
of the English system is unavoidable, supply metric equivalents in
parentheses. Use the decimal system for precise measurements and
relationships, common fractions for approximations. Use day/month/year
sequence for dates: "9 April 1976." For months in tabular listings or
data sections, use three-letter abbreviations with no periods: "Jan,
Mar, Jun," etc. Omit space between initials of a personal name: "J.B.
Jones."</p>

<p><b>Arrange and paginate sequentially every sheet of manuscript</b> in the
following order: (1) title page, (2) abstract, (3) contents, (4)
foreword and/or preface, (5) text, (6) appendixes, (7) notes section,
(8) glossary, (9) bibliography, (10) legends, (11) tables. Index copy
may be submitted at page proof stage, but plans for an index should be
indicated when manuscript is submitted.</p>

Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Emphasis upon publication as a means of "diffusing knowledge" was
expressed by the first Secretary of the Smithsonian. In his formal plan
for the Institution, Joseph Henry outlined a program that included the
following statement: "It is proposed to publish a series of reports,
giving an account of the new discoveries in science, and of the changes
made from year to year in all branches of knowledge." This theme of
basic research has been adhered to through the years by thousands of
titles issued in series publications under the Smithsonian imprint,
commencing with Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge in 1848 and
continuing with the following active series:

               _Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics_
                  _Smithsonian Contributions to Botany_
            _Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences_
           _Smithsonian Contributions to the Marine Sciences_
               _Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology_
                 _Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology_
                     _Smithsonian Folklife Studies_
                 _Smithsonian Studies in Air and Space_
             _Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology_

In these series, the Institution publishes small papers and full-scale
monographs that report the research and collections of its various
museums and bureaux or of professional colleagues in the world of
science and scholarship. The publications are distributed by mailing
lists to libraries, universities, and similar institutions throughout
the world.

Papers or monographs submitted for series publication are received by
the Smithsonian Institution Press, subject to its own review for format
and style, only through departments of the various Smithsonian museums
or bureaux, where the manuscripts are given substantive review. Press
requirements for manuscript and art preparation are outlined on the
inside back cover.

ABSTRACT


Olson, Storrs L., and David C. Parris. The Cretaceous Birds of New
Jersey. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, number 63, 22
pages, 11 figures, 1987.--This is a revision of the fossil birds from
Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian; Hornerstown and Navesink formations)
deposits in New Jersey. Material of previously named taxa, described
over a century ago, is augmented by more recently collected specimens
from a new locality at the Inversand Company marl pits near Sewell,
Gloucester County. With about 8 genera and 9 species, this is the most
diverse Cretaceous avifauna yet known. Most species belong to a group
of primitive Charadriiformes resembling in limb morphology the fossil
family Presbyornithidae and the living family Burhinidae. These are
tentatively referred to the “form family” Graculavidae Fürbringer,
1888, with its provisional synonyms Palaeotringinae Wetmore, 1940;
Telmatornithidae Cracraft, 1972, and Laornithidae Cracraft, 1972. The
species included are: _Graculavus velox_ Marsh, 1872; _Telmatornis
priscus_ Marsh, 1870 (synonyms: _Telmatornis affinis_ Marsh, 1870;
_Graculavus pumilis_ Marsh, 1872; _Palaeotringa vetus_ Marsh, 1870);
_Anatalavis rex_ (Shufeldt, 1915); _Laornis edvardsianus_ Marsh, 1870;
_Palaeotringa littoralis_ Marsh, 1870; _P. vagans_ Marsh, 1872; and
an undescribed genus and species probably different from any of the
preceding. _Anatalavis_ is proposed as a new genus for Telmatornis rex
Shufeldt, 1915. A new family, genus, and species (Tytthostonychidae,
_Tytthostonyx glauconiticus_) is proposed for a humerus showing
similarities to the Pelecaniformes and Procellariiformes and
tentatively referred to the latter, along with an ulna of a much
smaller species. The species in this fauna appear to be part of the
modern radiation of neognathous birds, but none can be referred to
modern families.

Introduction


Fossils of Cretaceous birds are scarce and usually difficult
to interpret. The better known forms such as _Hesperornis_ and
_Ichthyornis_ belong to strange and archaic groups having little or
nothing to do with the modern avian radiation. The only areas that have
yielded Cretaceous birds of essentially modern aspect in sufficient
quantities to be regarded as avifaunal assemblages are the inland
deposits of the Lance Formation and strata of similar age in Wyoming
(Brodkorb, 1963a) and the marine deposits of New Jersey. Of these, the
assemblage from New Jersey is the more diverse.

Fossil birds were described from the Cretaceous greensands of southern
New Jersey over a century ago by Marsh (1870, 1872). These have been
carried, largely uncritically, in lists and compilations ever since
(e.g. Hay, 1902; Lambrecht, 1933; Rapp, 1943; Miller, 1955; Brodkorb,
1963b, 1967). Although some of these specimens were subsequently
re-examined and their status altered (Shufeldt, 1915; Cracraft, 1972,
1973), there has been no modern comprehensive revision of all of the
avian taxa that have been named from the Cretaceous of New Jersey. In
recent years, additional fossil birds have been recovered from these
deposits that add further to our knowledge of late Mesozoic avifaunas,
making a review of this material all the more desirable.

In spite of the relative diversity of the New Jersey Cretaceous
avifauna, the total number of specimens is still small. The decline
of the glauconite greensand industry and the difficulty of recovering
small fossils have contributed to this paucity of specimens. The
glauconite industry is now confined to a single operation, the
Inversand Company in Sewell, Mantua Township, Gloucester County, New
Jersey. Fortunately, the late owner of the company, Mr. Churchill
Hungerford, Jr., generously allowed fossils to be recovered on his
property by the New Jersey State Museum, which houses most of the newly
discovered specimens, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
being the repository of the rest. Another specimen came from a locality
in Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey and was donated
to the New Jersey State Museum by Gerard R. Case.

Acknowledgments.--We gratefully acknowledge the late Churchill
Hungerford, Jr., for permitting fossil material to be recovered from
his property by the New Jersey State Museum (NJSM). We are much
indebted to John H. Ostrom, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale
University (YPM), and Gay Vostreys and Charles Smart of the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) for their patience in
lending types and other material from their collections for a very
extended period. Pat V. Rich, Monash University, assisted Parris in
the early stages of this study. Comparative material of _Presbyornis_
was obtained from the collection of the University of California
Museum of Paleontology (UCMP), the University of Wyoming (UW), and the
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM).

=The Fossil Localities and Their Stratigraphy=

The extensive deposits of Cretaceous age in eastern North America
have been widely studied for over 150 years. These generally poorly
consolidated sediments have provided valuable resources, notably
glauconite, fire clay, and chalk. As the publications by Morton (1829),
Vanuxem (1829), Conrad (1869), and other early authors showed, the
sediments are also quite fossiliferous.

In the eastern United States, significant Cretaceous deposits occur
from New Jersey to Texas (Figure 1), with extensive outcrop and
subsurface records in both Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. The
surface distribution and correlations were first summarized by
Stephenson et al. (1942). Subsequent works by various authorities
have refined, but not substantially altered his views of outcrop
stratigraphy. Petroleum exploration has encouraged more recent restudy
of the subsurface stratigraphy, notably along the east coast (Minard et
al., 1974; Perry et al., 1975; Petters, 1976).

[Illustration: Figure 1.--Distribution of Cretaceous rocks in the
eastern United States. Arrow indicates New Jersey. (Modified after
Moore, 1958, fig. 15.2).]

In New Jersey, the latest Cretaceous deposits are remarkably rich
in glauconite, especially the Navesink and Hornerstown formations.
Besides providing a local industry in agricultural fertilizers, the
glauconite greensands, locally called “marl,” yielded many specimens to
the fiercely competitive vertebrate paleontologists of the nineteenth
century. Preservation of vertebrate fossils in a glauconite deposit may
be excellent, apparently due to autochthonous formation of the mineral
and the probable quiescence of the depositional environment. The
Hornerstown Formation, for example, contains few grains of terrigenous
origin and little evidence of disturbance by water currents.
Such depositional environments were apparently favorable for the
preservation of small and delicate bones. The accumulation of sediment
occurred during a period of marine transgression with the shoreline not
far to the northwest but at sufficient distance to prevent deposition
of terrigenous material.

During their great rivalry, E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh sought greensand
fossils vigorously. Marsh, however, obtained all of the Cretaceous
birds (Marsh, 1870, 1872), largely due to efforts of marl pit owner
J.G. Meirs. Although in the years subsequent to Marsh's original
descriptions of the New Jersey birds from the Navesink and Hornerstown
formations there was some confusion regarding their probable age
(Wetmore, 1930), this was later definitely established as Cretaceous
by Baird (1967), who attributed the specimens to the Navesink and
Hornerstown formations.

The summary of Petters (1976) represents current ideas of the
Cretaceous stratigraphy of New Jersey. Baird's (1967) discussion is
consistent with Petters's view that the Hornerstown Formation is
regarded as partly Cretaceous and partly Tertiary. Some authors have
used the term New Egypt Formation instead of Navesink in more southerly
outcrops.

Cretaceous birds have been recovered from three geographically
distinct localities in New Jersey (Figure 2). With the exception of
_Laornis_, all of the specimens described by Marsh (1870, 1872) came
from Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County, in the area including
the settlements of Hornerstown, Arneytown, and Cream Ridge. The Meirs
family operated a number of pits in this area and it is no longer
possible to ascertain the exact provenance of specimens labelled only
as being from Hornerstown. These could have come either from the
basal Hornerstown Formation or the underlying Navesink Formation,
both of which are Maastrichtian in age. Baird (1967:261) ascertained
that the holotype of _Palaeotringa vetus_, from “friable green marl
near Arneytown” was from the lower (i.e., Cretaceous) part of the
Hornerstown Formation. The holotypes of _Telmatornis priscus_ and _T.
affinis_, from the Cream Ridge Marl Company pits, on the other hand,
are from the Navesink Formation. A more recently collected specimen
from this area is the proximal end of an ulna (NJSM 11900) collected
by Gerard R. Case from “marl piles near junction of Rtes. 537 and
539 in Upper Freehold Twp., Monmouth County, near Hornerstown.” This
definitely came from the Hornerstown Formation but it cannot be said
whether from the Cretaceous or Paleocene sediments included therein.

[Illustration: Figure 2.--Localities in southern New Jersey of the
main fossiliferous deposits that have yielded Cretaceous birds. (The
bold line demarcates the inner and outer coastal plain physiographic
provinces; B = Birmingham; H = Hornerstown; S = Sewell.)]

The second general locality is near Birmingham, Burlington County,
where the type of _Laornis edvardsianus_ was obtained from “greensand
of the upper, Cretaceous marl bed ... in the pits of the Pemberton Marl
Company” (Marsh, 1870:208). There is nothing to be added to Baird's
(1967) conclusion that this specimen is latest Cretaceous in age.

The third locality, and that yielding most of the recently obtained
specimens, is the Inversand Company marl pit, located near Sewell,
Gloucester County. In accordance with the wishes of the Inversand
Company, the precise locality of this pit will not be disclosed,
although this information is preserved in records sufficient in number
and distribution to assure that it will not be lost. The Inversand
specimens came from the main fossiliferous layer within the basal
portion of the Hornerstown Formation (Figure 3). This layer is of late
Maastrichtian age (latest Cretaceous), on the basis of invertebrate
fossils, including three genera of ammonites, and a substantial
vertebrate fauna, including mosasaurs (see Appendix). It is probable
that the upper part of the Hornerstown Formation within the pit is of
Paleocene age, as it is known to be elsewhere, but most paleontologists
believe the basal portion to be Cretaceous in age (Gaffney, 1975; Koch
and Olsson, 1977). One avian specimen is from an unknown level in the
pit.

=Order Charadriiformes=

=“Form Family” Graculavidae Fürbringer, 1888=


Type Genus.--Graculavus Marsh, 1872.

Included Genera.--_Graculavus_ Marsh, 1872; _Telmatornis_ Marsh, 1870;
_Anatalavis_, new genus; _Laornis_ Marsh, 1870; _Palaeotringa_ Marsh,
1870; and an additional unnamed genus.

Remarks.--Most of the birds from the New Jersey deposits belong with
what Olson (1985) has termed the “transitional Charadriiformes,” a
group that seemingly tends to connect the Gruiformes and the more
typical Charadriiformes. The only living family in this group that
has traditionally been considered charadriiform is the Burhinidae,
the thick-knees or stone curlews. Other apparent descendants include
ibises (Plataleidae) and the ducks and geese of the order Anseriformes.
The latter are linked with the “transitional Charadriiformes” through
the Paleocene and Eocene genus _Presbyornis_, which is known from
abundant material from widely scattered areas of the world (Olson and
Feduccia, 1980b; Olson, 1985). _Presbyornis_ combines a long-legged
shorebird-like body with the head of a duck. The fragmentary Cretaceous
fossils from New Jersey, all of which are postcranial, usually show
more similarity to _Presbyornis_ than to any modern group of birds
except the Burhinidae. Therefore, our comparisons have been made
chiefly with these two groups.

With the fragmentary material at hand it is difficult, well nigh
impossible, to make hard and fast taxonomic judgments concerning the
number of species, genera, or families represented. Birds with very
similar wing or leg elements could have had completely different
feeding adaptations and could represent ancestral forms leading to
different modern groups not considered to be closely related. For
example, without the skull, _Presbyornis_ could not be determined as
having anything to do with the Anseriformes (Olson and Feduccia, 1980b:
12-13).

Late Cretaceous fossil birds of modern aspect have been described in
a variety of genera, most of which have been used as the basis for
family-group names. Taxa from New Jersey that appear to belong with
the “transitional Charadriiformes” for which family-group names are
available include: Graculavinae Fürbringer, 1888; Palaeotringinae
Wetmore, 1940; Telmatornithidae Cracraft, 1972; and Laornithidae
Cracraft, 1973.

Taxa from Upper Cretaceous deposits in western North America that
appear to fall in the same category (Olson and Feduccia, 1980a)
include: Apatornithidae Fürbringer, 1888; Cimolopterygidae Brodkorb,
1963a; Torotigidae Brodkorb, 1963a; and Lonchodytidae Brodkorb, 1963a.

Tertiary taxa that may possibly be related to the “transitional
Charadriiformes” and that have been used as the basis of family-group
names are: Presbyornithidae Wetmore, 1926 (Nautilornithinae Wetmore,
1926, and Telmabatidae Howard, 1955, are definitely synonyms);
Scaniornithidae Lambrecht, 1933; and Dakotornithidae Erickson, 1975.

Doubtless there are others that we have overlooked. How many families
are actually represented here and what their interrelationships may
be is purely a matter of conjecture in the absence of better fossil
material. Because the entire skeleton of _Presbyornis_ is known, the
familial name Presbyornithidae may justifiably be retained and used for
that genus.

In the case of the Cretaceous birds under consideration here, we
have decided for the time being to adopt a version of paleobotanical
convention in recognizing a “form family” Graculavidae, which implies a
general similarity in morphology of the constituent taxa, although the
material available is simply not sufficient for determining phylogeny
or key adaptations.

Comparisons.--Marsh (1872) originally described this as a species of
cormorant (Phalacrocoracidae, Pelecaniformes) and included the species
_G. pumilis_ Marsh, 1872, also from New Jersey, and _G. anceps_ Marsh,
1872, from the Late Cretaceous of Kansas, in the same genus. Marsh
(1880) later referred _G. anceps_ to the genus _Ichthyornis_, where it
has remained. Shufeldt (1915:17-19) went into considerable detail to
show that the species of _Graculavus_, particularly _G. velox_, were
not cormorants, instead being limicoline shorebirds with similarities
to the Burhinidae, Haematopodidae, and Charadriidae. Accordingly,
Lambrecht (1933:540, 546) placed these taxa among the charadriiform
birds, but rather inexplicably listed velox under Shufeldt's substitute
name _Limosavis_ in the suborder Laro-Limicolae, while retaining
_pumilis_ in the genus _Graculavus_ in the suborder Limicolae.
Brodkorb (1963b:249) ignored Shufeldt's assessment of relationships
and placed _G. velox_ and _G. pumilis_ in the Phalacrocoracidae,
subfamily Graculavinae. Cracraft (1972) did not examine the specimens
attributed to _Graculavus_ in his consideration of the relationships of
_Telmatornis_.

We have synonymized _Graculavus pumilis_ Marsh, 1872, with
_Telmatornis priscus_ Marsh, 1870, and discuss below the characters
by which _Graculavus_ (restricted to _G. velox_) may be separated
from _Telmatornis_. Shufeldt (1915) has already presented adequate
evidence that _Graculavus_ is not a cormorant and is instead a
charadriiform. The following combination of characters of the proximal
end of the humerus is shared by _Graculavus_ and _Presbyornis_ and
distinguishes these genera from other Charadriiformes: (1) lack of
a distinct lanceolate scar for M. coracobrachialis cranialis; (2)
lack of a distinctly excavated second (dorsal) tricipital fossa; (3)
presence of a distinct tumescence in the proximoventral portion of the
tricipital fossa; scars for (4) M. scapulohumeralis caudalis and (5)
M. scapulohumeralis cranialis very large and distinct; (6) attachment
of M. latissimus dorsi cranialis a well-defined, raised protuberance
situated dorsal to the median ridge of the shaft; (7) tuberculum
dorsale well defined, distinctly pointed. In most of the preceding
characters that it preserves, the single proximal end of humerus
referred to _Telmatornis_ (the holotype of _G. pumilis_) agrees with
_Graculavus_ and _Presbyornis_.

Among living families, the Burhinidae are the most similar to
_Graculavus_; both agree in characters 1, 2, 4, and 7, with certain
species of _Burhinus_ also having characters 3 and 6 present but less
developed. _Graculavus_ differs from Burhinus mainly in having (8) the
head not as deep and bulbous; (9) distance from head to tuberculum
dorsale greater; (10) tuberculum dorsale smaller, much less projecting;
(11) tuberculum ventrale in ventral view more elongate; and (12) scar
on tuberculum ventrale for M. coracobrachialis caudalis much larger and
more distinct.

_Graculavus_ is very similar to _Presbyornis_, agreeing with that
genus in characters 8 and 10 but differing in characters 11 and 12
and in (13) having the head more deeply undercut. _Presbyornis_ is
intermediate between _Graculavus_ and the _Burhinidae_ in character 9.

_Graculavus velox_ was a fairly large bird, being approximately the
size of _Presbyornis_ cf. _pervetus_ and somewhat larger than the large
living burhinid _Esacus magnirostris_.

Locality and Horizon.--Collected from the main fossiliferous layer of

Comparisons.--Nothing can be said about this very poor specimen except
that it came from a bird with a carpometacarpus slightly larger than
that of a modern specimen of the burhinid _Esacus magnirostris_.
Because _Graculavus velox_ is the only bird yet known in the New Jersey
fossil fauna that was of this same size, the present specimen may
possibly be referable to that species.

Comparisons.--This is evidently the most abundant bird in the
New Jersey Cretaceous deposits. Hitherto it had been known only
from the two distal ends of humeri that are the holotypes of
_Telmatornis priscus_ and _T. affinis_. Marsh (1870) did not clearly
place _Telmatornis_ with any living family but mentioned species
of Rallidae, Scolopacidae, and Ardeidae in his comparisons. Hay
(1902:528) listed the genus under the Rallidae. Shufeldt (1915:26)
considered that _Telmatornis_ was not a heron but might be related
either to rail-like or charadriiform birds, the material, according
to him, being insufficient for positive determination. He (1915:27)
also described a larger species, _Telmatornis rex_, which we have
removed to a new genus. Lambrecht (1933:489) maintained _Telmatornis_
as a genus incertae sedis in his order Ralliformes. Brodkorb (1967)
placed the genus in the family Rallidae, subfamily Rallinae, without
comment. Cracraft (1972) established that Telmatornis did not belong
in the Rallidae but was instead very similar to the Burhinidae. He
synonymized _T. affinis_ with _T. priscus_ and created a new family,
Telmatornithidae, for _T. priscus_ and _T. rex_.

We concur in synonymizing _T. affinis_ with _T. priscus_. The holotypes
and the new specimen of humerus (ANSP 15360), which is instructive in
that it preserves much more of the shaft (Figure 6_c_), are indeed
very similar to the humeri in the Burhinidae. In size they are closely
comparable to the small living species _Burhinus vermiculatus_ (cf.
Figure 6_g,h_). The fossils differ from _Burhinus_ in having (1) the
shaft less curved, both in dorsal and in lateral views; (2) brachial
depression shorter, wider, and slightly more distally located; in
distal view (3) the ventral condyle smaller and less rounded; and (4)
the dorsal tricipital groove shallower.

The distal portion of the humerus of _Telmatornis_ is similar to that
in _Presbyornis_ but differs in having (1) the dorsal condyle decidedly
more elongate; (2) olecranal fossa much shallower; (3) ventral
epicondyle in ventral view less distinctly demarcated but (4) more
protrudent in lateral or medial view.

The proximal end of humerus (YPM 850) that is the holotype of
_Graculavus pumilis_ was considered by Shufeldt (1915:19) definitely
to be from a limicoline charadriiform. It is from a bird exactly the
size of _Telmatornis priscus_ and its coloration and preservation would
not be incompatible with its being the opposite end of the same bone
as the holotype of _T. affinis_ (Figure 5_b,c,f,g_). The following
differences between the holotypical humeri of _G. velox_ and _“G.”
pumilis_ establish that these belong to different genera: (1) in
_velox_ the area dorsal to the ventral tubercle and distal to the head
is much more excavated, undercutting the head; (2) the dorsal tubercle
is more pronounced; (3) there is a distinct excavation distomedial to
the ventral tubercle, lacking in _pumilis_; (4) the ventral tubercle in
ventral view is much more produced in _velox_ than in _pumilis_.

The holotype of _G. pumilis_ is very similar to the humerus in the
Burhinidae but differs from that family and agrees with _Graculavus_
in characters 8, 9, and 10 (p. 6). It differs further from the
Burhinidae in having the area for the attachment of M. scapulohumeralis
caudalis extending farther distally in ventral view. It differs from
_Presbyornis_ mainly in lacking the excavation to and undercutting
the head. Because pumilis is not congeneric with _Graculavus velox_
and because of its size and similarities with the Burhinidae and
_Presbyornis_, we have no hesitation about considering Graculavus
pumilis Marsh, 1872, to be a junior subjective synonym of _Telmatornis
priscus_ Marsh, 1870.

The proximal end of an ulna, NJSM 11900 (Figure 5_j_), is from a bird
the size of _Burhinus vermiculatus_ and not too dissimilar to it
except that the shaft is more robust in the fossil. The specimen is
too imperfect to merit detailed study and is referred to Telmatornis
priscus only on size and probability.

The very fragmentary distal end of carpometacarpus associated with the
type of _G. pumilis_ (Figure 5_i_) is slightly larger and more robust
than in _Burhinus vermiculatus_, but not so much as to be incompatible
with _T. priscus_. Compared to _Burhinus_ (1) the symphysial area
is deeper and (2) the articular surface for the major digit is
proportionately larger, the specimen being somewhat more similar to the
carpometacarpus in _Presbyornis_.

The three specimens of _Palaeotringa_ Marsh from the Cretaceous of New
Jersey are based on poorly preserved distal ends of tibiotarsi. The
holotype of _Palaeotringa vetus_ Marsh, 1870 (Figure 7_n_) is similar
in size to the comparable element in _Burhinus vermiculatus_, though
with a relatively more slender shaft, and hence is from a bird the
size of _T. priscus_, being smaller than any of the other species of
_Palaeotringa_. It is more similar to _Presbyornis_ than to _Burhinus_.
Because it is from a charadriiform the size of _T. priscus_, as first
revisers we tentatively consider _Palaeotringa vetus_ Marsh, 1870,
to be a subjective synonym of _Telmatornis priscus_ Marsh, 1870. The
only alternative would be to consign it to Aves incertae sedis. It is
of passing historical interest to recall Marsh's (1870:209) comment
that the type of _Palaeotringa vetus_ “apparently was the first fossil
bird-bone discovered in this country,” having been mentioned both by
Morton (1834) and Harlan (1835) as belonging to the genus _Scolopax_
(Charadriiformes: Scolopacidae).

The distal portion of tarsometatarsus NJSM 11853 (Figure 7_d,g,f_)
is unfortunately quite abraded. It is from a small charadriiform and
has a shaft width about the same as in _Burhinus vermiculatus_. If
this fossil came from an individual of _Telmatornis priscus_, as we
assume, _T. priscus_ being the smallest and most abundant “graculavid”
in the New Jersey Cretaceous deposits, then it is a very instructive
specimen, for it differs much more from Burhinus than does the humerus
of Telmatornis. NJSM 11853 differs from the Burhinidae and agrees with
_Presbyornis_ in having (1) the distal foramen proportionately large
and oval, not very small and circular; (2) a large, well-developed scar
for the hallux (hallux absent in Burhinidae); (3) external trochlea
proximodistally more elongate. That which remains of the inner trochlea
indicates that it was (1) somewhat more posteriorly retracted than
in _Burhinus_ but (2) not nearly as elevated and retracted as in
_Presbyornis_.

Pedal phalanx ANSP 15541 (Figure 7_a_) is from a bird the size of _T.
priscus_. This specimen is much longer and more slender than phalanx 1
of digit II in _Burhinus vermiculatus_ but has almost exactly the shape
and proportions of the same element in _Presbyornis_ (Figure 7_b_),
although being much smaller. Although its assignment to _Telmatornis_
is very tentative, the length of this element seems to indicate a
wading bird as opposed to one with the terrestrially adapted shorter
toes of the Burhinidae.




=Genus _Anatalavis_, new genus=


Type-Species.--Telmatornis rex Shufeldt, 1915.

Included Species.--Type-species only.

Diagnosis.--Differs from _Telmatornis_ and _Presbyornis_ in (1) having
the shaft very short, stout, and much more curved, both in dorsoventral
and lateromedial views. Differs from _Telmatornis_ and agrees with
_Presbyornis_ in (2) having the distal end in distal view deeper, with
(3) a narrower and much deeper olecranal fossa. Also, (4) the brachial
depression is smaller and narrower than in _Telmatornis_ but not as
deep, nor as proximally situated as in _Presbyornis_.

Etymology.--“Duck-winged bird,” from Latin _anas_, duck, _ala_, wing,
and _avis_, bird. The gender is feminine.

Referred Specimen.--Paratypical left humerus lacking proximal end,
YPM 948 (Figure 6_b,d,f_). From Hornerstown, Upper Freehold Township,
Monmouth County, New Jersey; collected by J.G. Meirs in 1869; probably
Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian), basal Hornerstown Formation.

Measurements (in mm).--Humeri (YPM 902, YPM 948, respectively): distal
width 13.6, 13.2; depth through dorsal condyle 7.3, 7.5; width of shaft
at proximal extent of brachial fossa 7.2,7.5; length from distal end of
pectoral crest to ventral condyle 49.1, 50.7; shaft width at midpoint
5.4, 5.6.

Remarks.--Shufeldt (1915:27) described this species in the same genus
as _T. priscus_ and _T. affinis_ but correctly noted that the humerus
“is a short one ... its sigmoid curve very pronounced.” Cracraft
(1972:41) considered that “except for its decidedly larger size, _T.
rex_ does not differ from _T. priscus_ in any significant features.”
In fairness to these authors, it should be noted that the great
differences between Anatalavis and Telmatornis are much more apparent
in comparisons with the new humerus of _T. priscus_ (ANSP 15360), which
preserves much more of the shaft than the previously known specimens.
Both Shufeldt and Cracraft considered YPM 948 to belong to the same
species as the holotype of _T. rex_, and we concur.

The specimens of _A. rex_ are not comparable with the type of
_Graculavus velox_, which was from a larger bird. _Anatalavis rex_
was a larger, heavier bird than _Telmatornis priscus_, with the
humerus remarkably short and robust, so that the overall length of the
humerus in _A. rex_ would scarcely have exceeded that of _T. priscus_.
_Anatalavis_ must have been a bird of considerably different flight
habits from _Telmatornis_ or _Presbyornis_. The overall appearance of
its humerus is in fact rather duck-like, except for the more expanded
distal end. It is still quite short and stout even for a duck.

Holotype.--Distal end of right tibiotarsus, YPM 820.

Locality and Horizon.--From pits of the Pemberton Marl Company at
Birmingham, Burlington County, New Jersey; collected by J.C. Gaskill;
Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian), basal Hornerstown Formation.

Measurements (in mm).--Distal end of tibiotarsus, YPM 820: distal width
across condyles 22.6, depth of external condyle 19.3, depth of internal
condyle 21.1, least shaft width 11.7, least shaft depth 9.6.

Comparisons.--The very large size of this specimen has undoubtedly
been a factor in misleading those who have attempted to identify
it, as it came from a bird the size of a swan or a large crane.
The affinities of this fossil have long been questioned and the
species has for most of its history been in limbo. Marsh (1870:207)
concluded only that _Laornis_ “shows a strong resemblance in several
respects to the _Lamellirostres_ [Anseriformes], and also to the
_Longipennes_ [Charadriiformes (Lari) and Procellariiformes], but
differs essentially from the typical forms of both of these groups.” In
its own nebulous way, this assessment is concordant with our placement
of _Laornis_ in a charadriiform group that was near the ancestry of
the Anseriformes. Doubtless only on the strength of Marsh's comments.
Cope (1869-1870:237) placed _Laornis_ in the “Lamellirostres.” Hay
(1902:531) included _Laornis_ in the Anatidae. Shufeldt (1915:23)
hardly clarified matters when he characterized _Laornis_ as “at least
one of the generalized types of waders,” being a “remarkable type,
which seems to have, judging from this piece of the tibiotarsus,
Turkey, Swan, Crane, and even other groups all combined in it.”
Lambrecht (1933:526) included _Laornis_ as a genus incertae sedis in
his “Telmatoformes,” between the Aramidae and Otididae.

The type was restudied by Cracraft (1973:46) who put _Laornis_ in the
Gruiformes and created a new family (Laornithidae) and superfamily
(Laornithoidea) for it. He included it in his suborder Ralli, the only
other member of which was the Rallidae. After preliminary comparisons,
Olson (1974) ventured that _Laornis_ belonged in the suborder Lari
of the Charadriiformes. Brodkorb (1978:214) listed _Laornis_ under
Aves incertae sedis and guessed that it might be related to the
Pelecaniformes.

Except for the extreme difference in size, the tibiotarsus of _Laornis_
is in many respects similar to that of _Presbyornis_ (Figure 8),
especially in (1) the shape and position of the tubercle proximal to
the external condyle; (2) the transverse pit in the intercondylar
sulcus; and (3) the broad, shallow intercondylar sulcus as seen in
distal view. It differs in a seemingly minor but quite characteristic
feature, the large nutrient foramen situated in the groove for M.
peroneus brevis (Figure 8_c_). This is absent in _Presbyornis_ but is
present in both of the tibiotarsi from the Cretaceous of New Jersey
in which that portion of the bone is preserved (the holotypes of
Palaeotringa littoralis and _P. vagans_), as well as in a tibiotarsus
(Science Museum of Minnesota P75.22.25) from the type-locality of
_Dakotornis cooperi_ Erickson, 1975, that may be referable to that
graculavid-like species. The foramen in the peroneus brevis groove
may also be found in at least some specimens of Stercorariidae, which
is partly what led Olson (1974) to suggest a relationship between
_Laornis_ and the Lari. _Laornis_ appears to have been an extremely
large member of the “transitional Charadriiformes,” though where its
relationships may lie within that group cannot be determined.

Comparisons.--This specimen and that of _P. vagans_ are too fragmentary

M. peroneus brevis, mentioned above. Their overall similarity to
_Presbyornis_ and to charadriiform birds in general justifies retaining
them with the other “graculavids” but other than this little else can
be said. In size, _Palaeotringa littoralis_ would have been about
equal to _Burhinus bistriatus vocifer_ and smaller than _Esacus
magnirostris_. Hence it would seem to be too small to belong to the
same species as _Graculavus velox_ and is definitely too large to be
referable to _Telmatornis priscus_.

Referred Material.--Distal portion of a left humerus, NJSM 11303.

Locality and Horizon.--Collected from the main fossiliferous layer of
the Inversand Company marl pit, Sewell, Gloucester County, New Jersey;
Hornerstown Formation, latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian); collected 27
September 1972 by David C. Parris.

Measurements (in mm).--Distal width 12.8, depth through dorsal condyle
6.9, width of shaft at proximal extent of brachial fossa 8.2.

Comparisons.--This interesting specimen, although considerably worn,
clearly has the overall “graculavid” morphology but shows sufficient
differences from the humeri of _Telmatornis_ or _Anatalavis_ to warrant
its generic separation from them. In size it is about equal to the
modern form _Burhinus bistriatus vocifer_ and hence would be compatible
with _P. littoralis_. It differs from _Telmatornis_, _Anatalavis_, or
_Presbyornis_, and is more similar to _Burhinus_ in having (1) the
brachial depression wider, shallower, and more proximally situated.
Although affected by wear, (2) the dorsal condyle is nevertheless
considerably smaller and not produced as far proximally as in any of
the preceding genera, although _Presbyornis_ is more similar in this
respect than the others. In distal view the specimen is more similar
to _Presbyornis_ than to the other Cretaceous humeri, although (3) the
olecranal fossa is shallower. If this specimen is correctly referred
to _Palaeotringa_, it shows that genus to be distinct from any of the
others yet known in the fauna except possibly _Graculavus_, for which
the distal end of the humerus is unknown.

  _Palaeotringa vagans_ Marsh, 1872:365.

Holotype.--Fragmented distal two-thirds of a left tibiotarsus lacking
the external condyle and the anterior portion of the internal condyle,
YPM 835.

Locality and Horizon.--From Hornerstown, Upper Freehold Township,
Monmouth County, New Jersey; collected by J.G. Meirs; Late Cretaceous
(Maastrichtian), “about ten feet below the surface of the marl” (Marsh,
1872:365), either basal Hornerstown Formation or Navesink Formation.

Measurements (in mm).--Width of shaft just proximal to external condyle
5.8.

Comparisons.--This very unsatisfactory specimen comes from a species
smaller than _P. littoralis_ and larger than _P. vetus_ (= _Telmatornis
priscus_). It differs from the latter and agrees with _P. littoralis_
in having the distal tendinal opening of a flattened oval shape, rather
than decidedly rounded. If we have correctly referred _P. vetus_ to
_Telmatornis priscus_, then it is certain that neither of the other
two species of _Palaeotringa_ can be referred to _Telmatornis_. In _P.
vagans_ the tendinal groove appears to be much narrower and the bridge
much deeper than in _P. littoralis_, but this is in part due to damage
and possible immaturity in the latter specimen, so it remains possible
that these species are in fact congeneric. The species _P. vagans_ can
be retained as it is smaller than any of the other graculavids in the
fauna except _T. priscus_, from which it is generically distinct.

Figure 9_b,c_


Referred Material.--Abraded distal end of left humerus and associated
proximal portion of humeral shaft, proximal end of radius, and fragment
of shaft of ulna, NJSM 11302.

Locality and Horizon.--Collected from the main fossiliferous layer of
the Inversand Company marl pit, Sewell, Gloucester County, New Jersey;
Hornerstown Formation, latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian); collected 15
August 1972 by David C. Parris.

Measurements (in mm).--Humerus: distal width 19 mm, depth through
dorsal condyle 9.7, width of shaft at proximal extent of brachial fossa
11.0; greatest proximal diameter of radius 7.0.

Comparisons.--The distal end of the humerus is the only reasonably
diagnostic element in this assortment and indicates a large, robust
species that would have exceeded in size any of the others known in
this Cretaceous avifauna except _Laornis edvardsianus_, which was
much larger still. In size this bird would have approximated the
modern flamingo _Phoeniconaias minor_, which it somewhat resembles in
morphology as well. The humerus is not greatly different from that
of other Graculavidae in general aspect but is distinct in having a
larger, much deeper, and more proximally situated brachial depression.
It represents a species distinct from any of the others yet known
in the fauna and is certainly generically distinct from all except
possibly _Graculavus_, for which comparable elements are unknown.




=Order Procellariiformes?=


Among the newly collected material from the Inversand pit is a singular
avian humerus that cannot be assigned to the Graculavidae or to
any other known family, fossil or modern. Although it is generally
inadvisable to name even Paleogene birds on single elements, to say
nothing of Cretaceous ones, the specimen under consideration here is
superior to any of the other avian fossils yet collected from the
Cretaceous of New Jersey, both in preservation and in diagnostic
qualities, and it would seem incongruous to leave it innominate when
practically all the other fragments from the same deposits have
received names.

The most distinctive features of this specimen are the deep brachial
depression and the incipient ectepicondylar spur, thus calling to mind
both the Lari (Charadriiformes) and the Procellariiformes among modern
birds. Among the Pelecaniformes it also bears a resemblance to the
Phaethontidae and especially to the Eocene frigatebird _Limnofregata_
(Fregatidae) (Olson, 1977).




=Family Tytthostonychidae, new family=


Type Genus.--_Tytthostonyx_, new genus.

Included Genera.--Type genus only.

Diagnosis.--Differs from the Lari and other Charadriiformes in (1)
the low, narrow head; (2) the very large, long pectoral crest; (3)
the virtual absence of the incisura capitis or any excavation for M.
coracobrachialis cranialis; and (4) the shallow, indistinct tricipital
grooves. It agrees with the Procellariiformes and differs from
_Phaethon_ and _Limnofregata_ in characters 2 and 4, and in the large,
deeply excavated brachial depression. The ectepicondylar spur is better
developed than in any of the Pelecaniformes but not as well developed
as in the Procellariiformes. The apparently very broad pectoral crest
extends much farther distally than in any of the Procellariiformes or
even in _Limnofregata_, to which the fossil is somewhat more similar
in this respect. Tytthostonyx differs from any of the taxa compared in
having the ventral condyle very rounded, extending distally well past
the dorsal condyle.




=Genus _Tytthostonyx_, new genus=


Type-Species.--_Tytthostonyx glauconiticus_, new species.

Included Species.--Type species only.

Diagnosis.--As for the family.

Etymology.--Greek, _tytthos_, little, plus _stonyx_, any sharp point.
The name is masculine in gender and refers to the small, presumably
rudimentary, ectepicondylar spur. It should not be confused with the
coleopteran genus _Tytthonyx_, based on _onyx_, claw.

Figures 10, 11


Holotype.--Right humerus lacking the ventral tubercle, portions of the
pectoral crest, and other parts of the proximal end, where partially
reconstructed, NJSM 11341.

Locality and Horizon.--Main fossiliferous layer of the Inversand
Company marl pit, Sewell, Gloucester County, New Jersey; basal portion
of the Hornerstown Formation, latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian);
collected 11 October 1973 by David C. Parris.

Measurements of Holotype (in mm).--Length as reconstructed, 110; width
and depth of shaft at midpoint 7.0 × 5.6; distal width 14.8; depth
through dorsal condyle 8.7.

Etymology.--From Latin, _glaucus_ (Greek, _glaukos_), bluish green
or gray, sea-colored, applied to greensands because of their color,
although appropriate because of their marine origins as well; in
reference to the holotype having been recovered from beds of glauconite.

Remarks.--A possible relationship between the Procellariiformes and
Pelecaniformes has been previously suggested (Sibley and Ahlquist,
1972:70; Olson, 1985:142), and among the pelecaniform taxa most often
mentioned as being procellariiform-like are the Fregatidae. It is
tempting to regard the humerus of _Tytthostonyx_ as being similar
to that possessed by the ancestral stock that gave rise to the
Procellariiformes. Its similarities also to the Eocene frigatebird
_Limnofregata_ would thus be seen as corroborating the primitiveness
of the Fregatidae within the Pelecaniformes. Whereas _Tytthostonyx_
definitely has not achieved the highly distinctive and presumably
derived morphology of the humerus of modern Procellariiformes, the
incipient development of the ectepicondylar spur and deep brachial
depression could be interpreted as tending in that direction.

On the other hand, we must admit that we are dealing with only a
single bone and one of very great age at that, so that the risk of
overinterpreting the fossil is correspondingly great. We can only
discern the overall similarities of the specimen and phylogenetic
inferences can therefore be only tentative at best.

Referred Material.--Distal portion of left ulna ANSP 15713.

Locality and Horizon.--Inversand Company marl pit, near Sewell,
Gloucester County, New Jersey; Hornerstown Formation, Late Cretaceous
(Maastrichtian); not found in situ, collected on shelf formed by “blue
bed”; collected 31 August 1977 by Richard S. White.

Measurements (in mm).--Distal width 2.6, distal depth 3.1, width and
depth of shaft near point of break 1.8 × 1.9.

Comparisons.--This specimen comes from a very small bird. The only
modern pelagic birds in this size range are the storm-petrels of
the family Oceanitidae and the fossil resembles this family in the
extremely straight shaft of the ulna, the shape and depth of the
tendinal grooves, and the relatively well-developed scars for the
attachment of the secondaries. It differs from the Oceanitidae in
having the ventral lip of the external condyle much more rounded and
protrudent past the plane of the shaft, whereas the carpal tubercle in
dorsal view is markedly smaller. On this basis, the fossil certainly
could not be referred to the Oceanitidae and that it should be
associated with the Procellariiformes may be doubted as well.

Paleocene.

Measurements (in mm).--Distal width 4.3, distal depth 3.8.

Comparisons.--This is also from a very small bird, possibly the same
size as the species represented by the preceding ulna (ANSP 15713;
Figure 9_e,f_) but probably somewhat larger. It is characterized
by an extremely well-developed tubercle for the attachment of M.
gastrocnemius lateralis. A perfunctory perusal of modern taxa revealed
nothing similar.




=Discussion=


Because the specimens treated here are avian and of Mesozoic age, it is
almost certain that too much importance will be made of them by some
future authors. Indeed, it will probably be years before the literature
can be expunged of the records of presumed occurrences that arose from
previous misidentifications of these fossils. Therefore, in an effort
to forestall overenthusiasm for these fragments we shall present our
own brief assessment of their significance.

Unlike most other Cretaceous birds, such as the Hesperornithiformes,
Ichthyornithiformes, and Enantiornithiformes, which represent totally
extinct lineages (Olson, 1985), the Cretaceous birds of New Jersey are
of essentially modern aspect. However, there are no modern families
of birds represented in the fauna. The differences among the fossils
suggest that at least two orders are represented, but whether any or
all of the species can be placed in modern orders is more difficult
to say. This stems as much from the unsatisfactory state of the
ordinal classification of modern birds (Olson, 1981, 1985), as from
the incompleteness of the fossils. There are certain modern birds, for
example the Burhinidae, with sufficient similarities to some of the
Cretaceous fossils that there would be no problem with associating them
in the same ordinal-level taxon, though it would be more difficult to
say which other modern families should also be included.

The material is too poor to state how many families are represented
in the fauna, although if the various members of the “form-family”
Graculavidae were better known there can scarcely be any doubt that
more than one family would be recognized in this group. Within
the Graculavidae from New Jersey there appear to be six genera
(_Graculavus_, _Telmatornis_, _Palaeotringa_, _Laornis_, _Anatalavis_,
and an unnamed genus). These are diverse, ranging in size from the
smallest of the modern Burhinidae to that of a large crane. The very
short, robust, curved humeri of _Anatalavis_ indicate some diversity in
mode of flight as well. The greatest similarity of most of these forms
is to the early Paleogene bird _Presbyornis_, and then to the modern
family Burhinidae. Because these two groups are very different in their
habits and feeding adaptations we may expect that the various members
of the Graculavidae were probably as divergent from one another as are
_Presbyornis_ and _Burhinus_, their similarities being almost certainly
due to the retention of primitive characters.

Including the two genera and species that show some similarities to the
Procellariiformes, along with the small indeterminate femur, the total
avifauna from the New Jersey greensands comprises 8 or 9 genera and 9
or 10 species. As far as can be determined, all of the birds in this
assemblage were probably marine or littoral in habits. We certainly
would not interpret this as indicating that waterbirds are primitive
and that they gave rise to land birds, as suggested by Thulborn and
Hamley (1985) in their fantastic and highly improbable conjectures as
to the mode of life of _Archaeopteryx_. Indeed, just the opposite is
probably the case (Olson, 1985), the lack of Late Cretaceous fossils of
truly terrestrial or arboreal birds most likely being due to sampling
bias.

=REQUIREMENTS FOR SMITHSONIAN SERIES PUBLICATION=


=Manuscripts= intended for series publication receive substantive
review (conducted by their originating Smithsonian museums or offices)
and are submitted to the Smithsonian Institution Press with Form SI-36,
which must show the approval of the appropriate authority designated by
the sponsoring organizational unit. Requests for special treatment--use
of color, foldouts, case-bound covers, etc.--require, on the same form,
the added approval of the sponsoring authority.

=Review= of manuscripts and art by the Press for requirements of series
format and style, completeness and clarity of copy, and arrangement of
all material, as outlined below, will govern, within the judgment of
the Press, acceptance or rejection of manuscripts and art.

=Copy= must be prepared on typewriter or word processor, double-spaced,
on one side of standard white bond paper (not erasable), with 1¼"
margins, submitted as ribbon copy (not carbon or xerox), in loose
sheets (not stapled or bound), and accompanied by original art. Minimum
acceptable length is 30 pages.

=Front matter= (preceding the text) should include: =title page= with
only title and author and no other information, =abstract page= with
author, title, series, etc., following the established format; table of
=contents= with indents reflecting the hierarchy of heads in the paper;
also, =foreword= and/or =preface=, if appropriate.

=First page of text= should carry the title and author at the top
of the page; =second page= should have only the author's name and
professional mailing address, to be used as an unnumbered footnote on
the first page of printed text.

=Center heads= of whatever level should be typed with initial caps of
major words, with extra space above and below the head, but no other
preparation (such as all caps or underline, except for the underline
necessary for generic and specific epithets). Run-in paragraph heads
should use period/dashes or colons as necessary.

=Tabulations= within text (lists of data, often in parallel columns)
can be typed on the text page where they occur, but they should not
contain rules or numbered table captions.

=Formal tables= (numbered, with captions, boxheads, stubs, rules)
should be submitted as carefully typed, double-spaced copy separate
from the text; they will be typeset unless otherwise requested. If
camera-copy use is anticipated, do not draw rules on manuscript copy.

=Taxonomic keys= in natural history papers should use the
aligned-couplet form for zoology and may use the multi-level indent
form for botany. If cross referencing is required between key and text,
do not include page references within the key, but number the keyed-out
taxa, using the same numbers with their corresponding heads in the text.

=Synonymy= in zoology must use the short form (taxon, author,
year:page), with full reference at the end of the paper under
“Literature Cited.” For botany, the long form (taxon, author,
abbreviated journal or book title, volume, page, year, with no
reference in “Literature Cited”) is optional.

=Text-reference system= (author, year: page used within the text, with
full citation in “Literature Cited” at the end of the text) must be
used in place of bibliographic footnotes in all Contributions Series
and is strongly recommended in the Studies Series: “(Jones, 1910:122)"
or “...Jones (1910:122)." If bibliographic footnotes are required, use
the short form (author, brief title, page) with the full citation in
the bibliography.

=Footnotes=, when few in number, whether annotative or bibliographic,
should be typed on separate sheets and inserted immediately after the
text pages on which the references occur. Extensive notes must be
gathered together and placed at the end of the text in a notes section.

=Bibliography=, depending upon use, is termed “Literature Cited,”
"References," or "Bibliography.” Spell out titles of books, articles,
journals, and monographic series. For book and article titles use
sentence-style capitalization according to the rules of the language
employed (exception: capitalize all major words in English). For
journal and series titles, capitalize the initial word and all
subsequent words except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.
Transliterate languages that use a non-Roman alphabet according to the
Library of Congress system. Underline (for italics) titles of journals
and series and titles of books that are not part of a series. Use the
parentheses/colon system for volume (number): pagination: “10(2):5-9,”
For alignment and arrangement of elements, follow the format of recent
publications in the series for which the manuscript is intended.
Guidelines for preparing bibliography may be secured from Series
Section, SI Press.

=Legends= for illustrations must be submitted at the end of the
manuscript, with as many legends typed, double-spaced, to a page as
convenient.

=Illustrations= must be submitted as original art (not copies)
accompanying, but separate from, the manuscript. Guidelines for
preparing art may be secured from Series Section, SI Press. Ail
types of illustrations (photographs, line drawings, maps, etc.) may
be intermixed throughout the printed text. They should be termed
=Figures= and should be numbered consecutively as they will appear in
the monograph. If several illustrations are treated as components of a
single composite figure, they should be designated by lowercase italic
letters on the illustration; also, in the legend and in text references
the italic letters (underlined in copy) should be used: “Figure 9b.”
Illustrations that are intended to follow the printed text may be
termed =Plates=, and any components should be similarly lettered and
referenced: “Plate 9b ” Keys to any symbols within an illustration
should appear on the art rather than in the legend.

=Some points of style:= Do not use periods after such abbreviations
as “mm, ft, USNM, NNE.” Spell out numbers "one” through “nine” in
expository text, but use digits in all other cases if possible.
Use of the metric system of measurement is preferable; where use
of the English system is unavoidable, supply metric equivalents in
parentheses. Use the decimal system for precise measurements and
relationships, common fractions for approximations. Use day/month/year
sequence for dates: “9 April 1976." For months in tabular listings or
data sections, use three-letter abbreviations with no periods: “Jan,
Mar, Jun,” etc. Omit space between initials of a personal name: “J.B.
Jones.”

=Arrange and paginate sequentially every sheet of manuscript= in the
following order: (1) title page, (2) abstract, (3) contents, (4)
foreword and/or preface, (5) text, (6) appendixes, (7) notes section,
(8) glossary, (9) bibliography, (10) legends, (11) tables. Index copy
may be submitted at page proof stage, but plans for an index should be
indicated when manuscript is submitted.


       *       *       *       *       *



Transcriber Note

The caption for Figure 4 was moved to the page that the figure is on.
The species _Graculavus pumilis_ appears to have been mistyped in three
locations as _Graculavus pumilus_ and were corrected.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
